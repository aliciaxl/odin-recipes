    <h3>Dan Dan Noodle Recipe</h3>

        <p>In all of the different variations of Dan Dan Noodles
            out there, I've found that there's hardly much consistency in flavor, texture, 
            or even ingredients beyond the numbing sichuan peppercorn flavor. The diverse execution of
            this dish has been adapted many times over
            throughout many regions of China and beyond it's borders. My main 
            issue with many versions of this dish is a lack of 
            flavor complexity. But my iteration, after much recipe testing, 
            with its balance of spice, nuttiness, and sweetness not only is the tastiest
            so far, but also a homage to the Taiwanese style of this dish- flavored with more sesame flavor.
