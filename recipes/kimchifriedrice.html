    <h3>Kimchi Fried Rice Recipe</h3>

    <p>This recipe is one of my favorites to make because of a recipe trick my sister taught me that
        involves preparing the same ingredients multiple ways all within one dish. 
        We'll use both fried and fresh kimchi, as well as roasted and freshly minced garlic, giving this dish high flavor complexity.
      </p>
